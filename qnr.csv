MFA on Root Account 7DAFEmoDos

IAM Password Policy Yw2K9puPzl

Details:
The root user is the most privileged user in an AWS account, with full administrative access to all resources within the account, and in some cases cannot be constrained by security policies. Disabling programmatic access to the root user, establishing appropriate controls for the root user, and avoiding routine use of the root user helps reduce the risk of inadvertent exposure of the root credentials and subsequent compromise of the cloud environment.

MFA on Root Account 7DAFEmoDos

Password policies for IAM users should have strong configurations

MFA should be enabled for all IAM users that have a console password

* = Suggested but not mandatory

*Hardware MFA should be enabled for the root user

Details:
Sign-ins (authentication using sign-in credentials) can present risks when not using mechanisms like multi-factor authentication (MFA), especially in situations where sign-in credentials have been inadvertently disclosed or are easily guessed. Use strong sign-in mechanisms to reduce these risks by requiring MFA. We also recommend requiring strong password policies.

IAM Access Key Rotation DqdJqYeRm5

Exposed Access Keys 12Fnkpl8Y5

Details:
A workload requires an automated capability to prove its identity to databases, resources, and third-party services. This is accomplished using secret access credentials, such as API access keys, passwords, and OAuth tokens. Using a purpose-built service to store, manage, and rotate these credentials helps reduce the likelihood that those credentials become compromised. Never Exposed Access Keys to public like Git Repo.

IAM Use

CodeBuild GitHub or Bitbucket source repository URLs should use OAuth

IAM authentication should be configured for RDS clusters

IAM authentication should be configured for RDS instances

Details:
For workforce identities (employees and contractors), rely on an identity provider that allows you to manage identities in a centralized place. This makes it easier to manage access across multiple applications and systems, because you are creating, assigning, managing, revoking, and auditing access from a single location.
"
Security,SEC 2 How do you manage identities for people and machines?,P0 Audit and rotate credentials periodically - i.e. IAM Access Key Rotation,pillar_1_q02,pillar_1_q02choice7,Yes,"Trusted Advisor Checks: 
IAM Access Key Rotation DqdJqYeRm5

ACM certificates should be renewed after a specified time period

API Gateway REST and WebSocket API execution logging should be enabled

Secrets Manager secrets should have automatic rotation enabled

Secrets Manager secrets should be rotated within a specified number of days

Details:
Audit and rotate credentials periodically to limit how long the credentials can be used to access your resources. Long-term credentials create many risks, and these risks can be reduced by rotating long-term credentials regularly.

We recommend the access key is active and has been rotated in the last 90 days.

IAM principals should not have IAM inline policies that allow decryption actions on all KMS keys Hs4Ma3G134

IAM customer managed policies should not allow decryption actions on all KMS keys Hs4Ma3G133

Details:
It's a best practice to grant only the access that identities require to perform specific actions on specific resources under specific conditions. Use group and identity attributes to dynamically set permissions at scale, rather than defining permissions for individual users. For example, you can allow a group of developers access to manage only resources for their project. This way, if a developer leaves the project, the developer's access is automatically revoked without changing the underlying access policies.

No non-administrator users or roles have administrator privileges."
Security,SEC 3 How do you manage permissions for people and machines?,P2 Share resources securely within your organization,pillar_1_q03,pillar_1_q03choice3,Yes,"Trusted Advisor Checks: 
Amazon ECS task definitions should have secure networking modes and user definitions. Hs4Ma3G145 

CloudTrail log file validation should be enabled Hs4Ma3G109

AWS CloudTrail Logging vjafUGJ9H0

Details:
As the number of workloads grows, you might need to share access to resources in those workloads or provision the resources multiple times across multiple accounts. You might have constructs to compartmentalize your environment, such as having development, testing, and production environments. However, having separation constructs does not limit you from being able to share securely. By sharing components that overlap, you can reduce operational overhead and allow for a consistent experience without guessing what you might have missed while creating the same resource multiple times.

GuardDuty should be enabled

Details:
Security operations teams rely on the collection of logs and the use of search tools to discover potential events of interest, which might indicate unauthorized activity or unintentional change. However, simply analyzing collected data and manually processing information is insufficient to keep up with the volume of information flowing from complex architectures. Analysis and reporting alone don't facilitate the assignment of the right resources to work an event in a timely fashion."

The VPC default security group should not allow inbound and outbound traffic Hs4Ma3G118 

Details:
Group components that share sensitivity requirements into layers to minimize the potential scope of impact of unauthorized access. For example, a database cluster in a virtual private cloud (VPC) with no need for internet access should be placed in subnets with no route to or from the internet. Traffic should only flow from the adjacent next least sensitive resource. Consider a web application sitting behind a load balancer. Your database should not be accessible directly from the load balancer. Only the business logic or web server should have direct access to your database.

You should consider use cases like network failure, Availability Zone failure, or Regional failures when calculating this gap.
